### Hi, I'm Sam. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in New York, currently building [Seven](https://www.seveninvites.com/), an app for sending party invites and RSVPs. Prior to that, I worked at [PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog/) and founded a social network for music called [Tunestack](https://www.samwinslow.net/post/tunestack).

In my free time I love working with electronics, reading, and flying airplanes.
